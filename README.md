# BDI---Blimp-A.I.-
a simplification of an existing (obsolescent) navigational system, LORAN (Long Range Navigation), and the agent is a blimp. In simplistic terms, LORAN functions by propagating at least two (usually more) uniquely identifiable waves outward from fixed stations with known positions and times at known speeds. A receiver can determine how far each wave has traveled when it arrives. The intersection and subsequent trilateration from two waves provide a reasonable estimate of position.  Inside the OS X folder we have the needed libraries to display java drawing to the computer for a mac / linux. The viewer-B.jar file includes some needed methods and agent pictures. (Rays, Blimp, Radar stations etc).
